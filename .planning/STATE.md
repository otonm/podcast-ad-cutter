# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-14)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- aiohttp chosen as API server (already a dep; native async; SSE built-in)
- Same-process server model (SSE trivial without IPC; single-user local tool)
- Dual mode via `--serve` flag (preserves CLI behavior for cron/Docker)
- No auth for v1 (local network deployment; add in v2 if needed)
- In-process EventBus for SSE (decouples pipeline from web layer)
- Config changes apply on next run only (prevents mid-run drift)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns
