    Pipeline is the sole owner of :class:`Config`.  It extracts the plain
    data each component needs and passes it through their APIs — no component
    below Pipeline imports from the config module.

    Currently the pipeline performs two stages: downloading the RSS/Atom XML
    for the selected feeds, then parsing the XML into structured data.
    Further stages (transcription, ad detection, audio cutting) will be
    added here as new components.

        feed_name: When set, process only the feed whose title matches this
            string exactly, regardless of its ``enabled`` flag.  When
            ``None`` (default), only feeds marked ``enabled: true`` are
